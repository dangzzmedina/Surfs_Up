## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
* The purpose of this analysis is to extract data from databases to show how a company can succeed in specific geographic locations by analyzing trends on climate weather. In this Module we accomplished in looking at different stations in Hawaii to determine their temperatures during June and December.
## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* 1. We extracted data with SQL alchemy for the specific months to avoid missing critical data.
* 2. To convert the results in our analysis we created a list to append the temperature observations in all the stations that were provided
* 3. With the results, it looks that the business should thrive as the average temperature is warm.
* 4. We further decribed our analysis by gettign a summary statistics which shows the mean temperature but also to look the percentiles on their low temperatures.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

* I would add an analysis of foot traffic around the stations through the month of December and June to look which stations have high foot traffic in summer and in winter. With this information we could locate the perfect spot for the business.
